        A major theme in One Piece is dreams.<br> It's the motivating factor of all the Straw Hat Pirates, bar none. 
        Many minor characters have an arc regarding dreams they have or used to have. Nearly all the villians have
         at least implied that their dreams have been broken in some way.
